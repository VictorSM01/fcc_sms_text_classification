This repository contains my solution to the FreeCodeCamp challenge 'Neural Network SMS Text Classifier'.  

In this challenge, I created a machine learning model that classifies SMS messages as either "ham" or "spam". A "ham" message is a normal message sent by a friend. A "spam" message is an advertisement or a message sent by a company.
